The starting wage is $26/hour. We would like the new hire to work around 20 hours per week. Working hours will be approximately 8:00am-12:00pm Monday-Friday. (We can be flexible about starting a little later than 8:00am if that would be better for the candidate’s lifestyle.) This position would work well for a stay-at-home mom/dad, as it is fully remote and part-time. All Steel prioritizes a good home life for our employees.

At All Steel, we want to hire good talent for our company, and so we are posting this job at a starting wage that is approximately 30% higher than the national average for administrative assistants.

WHO SHOULD NOT APPLY FOR THIS JOB Please do not apply for this position if you want to manage teams of people or do highly interesting work. Although the work you will do is important for our company, it is repetitive and does not involve much collaboration with others. We understand that some people may find this type of work boring, so we want to be candid on our job posting about the position’s requirements. (On the positive side of things: the high starting wage and fully remote setup will hopefully compensate for some of the position’s tedium.)
